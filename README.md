# Your Voice Matters: Ontario Needs Its Graduates

This site is a public comment on Proposal 25-MLITSD019. It explains why Ontario should keep an independent pathway for master's and PhD graduates and asks readers to act before January 1, 2026.

## Why this matters
- Ontario invested in graduate talent; closing the pathway forces them to leave.
- Without an independent Ontario pathway, graduates drift to jurisdictions that keep clear post-graduation routes.
- Federal direction prioritizes graduates; provincial policy should match.

## What we’re asking
1) Preserve an independent OINP pathway for Ontario master’s and PhD graduates.  
2) Grandfather current students who enrolled under existing rules.  
3) Publish impact analysis and review outcomes within 2–3 years.

## How to take action
- Submit a comment to the Ontario Regulatory Registry: https://www.regulatoryregistry.gov.on.ca/proposal/52773  
- Share the page: https://oinp.hubeiqiao.com  
- Pass it to classmates, faculty, employers, and community groups.

## Who this speaks for
- International graduates building AI, research, and innovation projects across SMEs, startups, and universities.
- Ontario taxpayers who benefit when locally trained talent stays and builds here.

## Fast facts
- Deadline: January 1, 2026.  
- Most vulnerable: master’s and PhD graduates who planned around the existing stream.  
- Risk: talent leaves for regions that still offer independent pathways.
