# Your Voice Matters: Ontario Needs Its Graduates

This site is a public comment on Proposal 25-MLITSD019. It explains why Ontario should keep an independent pathway for master's and PhD graduates and asks readers to act before January 1, 2026.

## What’s happening
- Ontario is considering folding the dedicated OINP stream for master’s and PhD graduates into broader employer-driven programs.
- The proposed change removes a predictable path for researchers who already invested years under the existing rules.
- Without a clear provincial option, graduates will follow talent pathways in provinces that keep independent streams.

## Why it matters to us
- Ontario taxpayers already funded this talent; losing them exports that public investment.
- Research teams, startups, and SMEs depend on these graduates to deliver products, IP, and jobs that anchor new industries.
- Removing the stream mid-program breaks trust with students who chose Ontario based on the published pathway.
- AI, health, and climate projects slow down when graduate founders and specialists leave for faster jurisdictions.

## What we’re asking for
1) Preserve an independent OINP pathway for Ontario master’s and PhD graduates.  
2) Grandfather current students who enrolled under existing rules.  
3) Publish an impact analysis and review outcomes within 2–3 years.  
4) Align provincial policy with the federal focus on retaining graduate talent.

## What other people can do
- Submit a comment to the Ontario Regulatory Registry: https://www.regulatoryregistry.gov.on.ca/proposal/52773  
- Share the page: https://oinp.hubeiqiao.com  
- Ask faculty, employers, industry groups, and MPs/MPPs to endorse keeping an independent graduate stream.
- Share data points: hiring delays, lost projects, or investments at risk without graduate retention.

## Who this speaks for
- International graduates building AI, research, and innovation projects across SMEs, startups, and universities.
- Ontario taxpayers who benefit when locally trained talent stays and builds here.

## Fast facts
- Deadline: January 1, 2026.  
- Most vulnerable: master’s and PhD graduates who planned around the existing stream.  
- Risk: talent leaves for regions that still offer independent pathways.
